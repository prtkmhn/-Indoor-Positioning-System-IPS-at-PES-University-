# Indoor Positioning System (IPS) at PES University 📍🏥

## About The Project 📘

The Indoor Positioning System (IPS) developed at PES University leverages advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to transform sensor data from Android phones into precise location data. This project achieves an impressive 92% accuracy in indoor positioning, making it particularly useful in hospital settings where quick location of personnel is crucial.

This system employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sensor fusion, location estimation, and trajectory prediction, enabling a robust and reliable indoor positioning system without the need for extensive hardware installations.
